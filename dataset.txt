** This Dataset is collected from UCI Machine Learning Repository **

The dataset that is used in our project is a pre-processed and re-structured/reshaped of the dataset(link)
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Epileptic+Seizure+Recognition .
It is very commonly used for featuring Epileptic Seizure Detection.

Original dataset that is reshaped consists of 5 various folders, each of them with a 100 files, each file representing single subject/person. 
Each file is a recording of a persons brain activity for 23.6 seconds. Corresponding Time-Series is sampled into a total of 4097 data points.
Each data point is value of  EEG recording at a different point in time. So we have total 500 individuals with each has 4097 data 
points for 23.5 seconds.

Our dataset have divided & shuffled every 4097 data points into 23 chunks, each chunk contains 178 data points for 1 second, 
and each data point is the value of the EEG recording at a different point in time. So now we have 23 multiplied by 500 = 11500. 
11500 pieces of information(rows), each information consists of 178 data points for 1 second(columns). 
Of all the columns the last column represents the label y {1,2,3,4,5}.

The response variable is y in column 179, the Explanatory variables X1, X2, â€¦, X178

y contains the category of the 178-dimensional input vector. Specifically y in {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:

5 - eyes open, means when they were recording the EEG signal of the brain the patient had their eyes open

4 - eyes closed, means when they were recording the EEG signal the patient had their eyes closed

3 - Yes they identify where the region of the tumor was in the brain and recording the EEG activity from the healthy brain area

2 - They recorder the EEG from the area where the tumor was located

1 - Recording of seizure activity
All subjects falling in classes 2, 3, 4, and 5 are subjects who did not have epileptic seizure. Only subjects in class 1 have epileptic seizure. Our motivation for creating this version of the data was to simplify access to the data via the creation of a .csv version of it. Although there are 5 classes most authors have done binary classification, namely class 1 (Epileptic seizure) against the rest.
